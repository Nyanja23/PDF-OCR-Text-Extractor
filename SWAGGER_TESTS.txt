Swagger UI Local Test Checklist

Base URL
- http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Open Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Quick smoke
- Load `/docs` and confirm the Swagger UI page renders and shows API groups.
- Hit `GET /health` -> expect 200 and JSON with `status: healthy` and service/version info.

Authentication (/api/auth)
- POST /api/auth/register
  - Payload example: {"email":"test-debug-2026@example.com","password":"Str0ngPass123!","full_name":"Debug User 2026"}
  - Expect success (200/201) and user info (or guidance to verify email).
  
- POST /api/auth/login
  - Payload: {"email":"test-debug-2026@example.com","password":"Str0ngPass123!","full_name":"Debug User 2026"}
  - Expect access token (JWT) or session token in response.
- Use Swagger "Authorize" UI (if provided): paste `Bearer <token>` and test protected endpoints.

Users (/api/users)
- GET /api/users/me (or GET /api/users/{id})
  - Test with valid token: expect user profile JSON.
  - Test without token: expect 401 Unauthorized.
- PUT/PATCH update user
  - Update profile fields, expect 200 and updated user data.

OCR (/api/ocr)
- POST /api/ocr/upload OR POST /api/ocr (file upload endpoints)
  - Use Swagger "Try it out" file upload to send a small PDF and a small image (png/jpg).
  - Expect 200/201 with job id or immediate result.
- GET /api/ocr/jobs/{job_id}/status
  - Poll until job reports `done`/`completed`.
- GET /api/ocr/jobs/{job_id}/result (or /api/ocr/results/{job_id})
  - Expect extracted text in JSON or a downloadable file. Verify text correctness for a known small sample.
- Test uploading unsupported file type (e.g., .exe) -> expect 400 or a clear error message.

Files and uploads
- Verify responses include any file URLs or job ids you can use.
- Confirm uploads are stored under `uploads/` while processing.
- Check `uploads/` cleanup behavior manually if necessary (files older than configured period should be removed by background task).

Error handling and edge cases
- Request a non-existent job id -> expect 404 with JSON error body.
- Send malformed JSON to POST endpoints -> expect 422 Unprocessable Entity.
- Test invalid auth token -> expect 401.

Rate limiting / middleware
- Rapidly send repeated requests to a protected endpoint and watch for 429 Too Many Requests if rate limiting is enabled.

CORS and headers
- From a browser or curl, send an `Origin` header and verify allowed origins behavior.
- Confirm `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` appears when expected.

Background tasks and DB
- Create a user and an OCR job; verify DB tables reflect created records (optional manual DB query).
- Upload a job and poll status until completion to validate background processing works.

Swagger-specific checks
- Ensure request/response models shown in Swagger match actual responses.
- Use "Try it out" for file uploads and JSON payloads; copy responses for further tests.

How to run locally
1. Start server (development):

   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

2. Open Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
3. Use the checklist above to exercise endpoints.

Notes
- Save any tokens returned by login to authorize subsequent requests in Swagger.
- If an endpoint name differs from these examples, use the equivalent shown in the Swagger UI.
- For longer end-to-end tests, prepare a small PDF with known text to verify OCR accuracy.

End of checklist.
